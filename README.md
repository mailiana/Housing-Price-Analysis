# Housing-Price-Analysis
This project was completed with my new cohort as part of a training session focused on teaching foundational Excel skills for data analysis.

# 1. Project Overview
This project explores housing price trends using Excel to analyze a dataset containing
various attributes like area, price, furnishing status, and utilities. The objective is to identify
patterns that impact pricing and help stakeholders make informed real estate decisions.

# 2. Objectives
● Identify average values across key metrics (price, area, bedrooms, etc.)
● Segment properties by price category: High, Medium, Low
● Explore how features like furnishing, AC, and basements affect price
● Create a clean, interactive dashboard to visualize insights

# 3. Methodology
**Data Cleaning:**  Removed null values, corrected data types, and standardized
formatting.
**Segmentation:** Grouped price data into High, Medium, and Low categories using
conditional logic.
**Pivot Tables & Charts:** Created pivot tables to summarize key features across price
ranges.
**Dashboard Creation:** Used slicers and charts to build an interactive report.
Functions Used: AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, PivotTables, slicers, filters, and
conditional formatting.

# 4. Key Findings
● The **average** house price is **₵4,767,740.19,** and the **average** area is **5,264 sq ft**.
● Most houses fall within the **Low price category**, making up **254** entries.
● Low-priced homes dominate all categories for furnishing, AC, and preference.
● The presence of **AC** and **furnishing** increases in the **Medium** to **High** price
categories.
● Basement inclusion appears more often in Medium-priced homes compared to
Low.
