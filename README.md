# Housing-Price-Analysis
This project was completed with my new cohort as part of a training session focused on teaching foundational Excel skills for data analysis.

# 1. Project Overview
This project explores housing price trends using Excel to analyze a dataset containing
various attributes like area, price, furnishing status, and utilities. The objective is to identify
patterns that impact pricing and help stakeholders make informed real estate decisions.

# 2. Objectives
● Identify average values across key metrics (price, area, bedrooms, etc.)
● Segment properties by price category: High, Medium, Low
● Explore how features like furnishing, AC, and basements affect price
● Create a clean, interactive dashboard to visualize insights

# 3. Methodology
**Data Cleaning:**  Removed null values, corrected data types, and standardized
formatting.
**Segmentation:** Grouped price data into High, Medium, and Low categories using
conditional logic.
**Pivot Tables & Charts:** Created pivot tables to summarize key features across price
ranges.
**Dashboard Creation:** Used slicers and charts to build an interactive report.
Functions Used: AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, PivotTables, slicers, filters, and
conditional formatting.

# 4. Key Findings
● The **average** house price is **₵4,767,740.19,** and the **average** area is **5,264 sq ft**.
● Most houses fall within the **Low price category**, making up **254** entries.
● Low-priced homes dominate all categories for furnishing, AC, and preference.
● The presence of **AC** and **furnishing** increases in the **Medium** to **High** price
categories.
● Basement inclusion appears more often in Medium-priced homes compared to
Low.

# 5. Conclusion & Recommendation
The analysis shows a strong concentration of properties in the Low price tier, which may
indicate affordability trends or market saturation in that segment. Properties with added
features like AC, basements, and furnishing tend to skew towards Medium or High pricing.
Recommendations:

● Real estate developers can target Medium-tier improvements to raise property value.
● Agents should highlight basement and AC status in listings to attract higher offers.
● Future analysis should include location-specific data for deeper insights.
